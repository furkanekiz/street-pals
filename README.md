## Description

I developed a mobile application for Android using Java that facilitates donations for street animals. The application emphasizes a clean and maintainable architecture, employing the MVVM design pattern. To enhance UI development, I utilized Android Jetpack's View Binding, ensuring efficient binding of UI components within the layout.

The app includes various fragments designed to enhance user interaction, such as a spinner fragment for selection processes and a slider for seamless navigation through images. For efficient image handling and loading, I integrated the Glide library, optimizing the user experience by ensuring smooth image rendering and minimal memory usage.
